A CSS library for code highlighting and decorating in a webpage

#What it does#

This CSS library creates an easy way to implement code highlighting on a webpage.

Eventually, I may add more to this library.

#Usage#

Put all code you wish to highlight into the pre and code tags to begin creating the code section. Now you can freely type your code. To highlight your example code add the correct class name to the piece of code for the css to highlight properly.

#Demos#

My personal webpage holds examples [here](https://github.com/Chippers255/EuchrePy)
